life`s rolling like a giant wheel 
this is s**k when u get so numb
its feel like in hell
u just stuck in a little hole
u cant out n u cant in
some bad act doing to refused
being a f**k in holy neighbourhood
like a s**t in their delicious style
hang arround and knifes come
kill again but it never end.(C)

life`s hangin on your mind
climb with a little love
do not afraid with your destiny
Shine,
and light follows you
feel heaven touch on your sight
kiss the torch of angel
believe in GOD power
HEAL. (c)
